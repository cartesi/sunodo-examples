# Echo low-level dApp

This example implements the same behavior as the [Echo dApp written in Python](../echo-python/), but here the back-end is written in C++ and uses the low-level Cartesi Rollup API instead of the HTTP API. 

As the other example, the dApp simply copies (or "echoes") each input received as a corresponding output notice.
