# Echo C++ dApp

This dApp implements the same behavior as the [Echo Python dApp](../echo-python/), but with a back-end written in C++.


## Building the application

To build the application, run:

```
sunodo build
```



## Running the application

This executes a Cartesi node for the application previously built with `sunodo build`.

```
sunodo run
```


## Interacting with the application

You can use the `sunodo send` command to send input payloads to your applications. 

With your node running, open a new terminal tab. You can send a generic input to your application as follows:

```shell
 sunodo send generic
```

For local testing, select `Foundary` which gives you mock and test faucets to submit transactions:

```
