# Echo-TypeScript dApp 

This dApp implements the same behavior as the [Echo Python dApp](../echo-python/), but with a back-end written in TypeScript.

This can be used as a template for TypeScript Cartesi DApps. It uses node to execute the backend application.

The application entrypoint is the `src/index.ts` file. It is bundled with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io), but any bundler can be used.
